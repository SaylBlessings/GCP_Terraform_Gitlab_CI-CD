This project provides a comprehensive guide on optimizing your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure using industry-standard tools. We'll delve into the specifics of Terraform, a powerful configuration language that allows you to define and manage your GCP resources as code. By automating the deployment process with Terraform, you can significantly reduce manual errors and increase efficiency. Additionally, we'll explore how to integrate GitLab CI/CD pipelines into your workflow. This enables continuous testing, building, and deployment of your infrastructure code changes, ensuring that your GCP environment remains up-to-date and reliable.
