This project presents a technical guide on optimizing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure utilizing industry-standard tools, focusing on Terraform, an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration language. By leveraging Terraform, GCP resources can be defined and managed as code, automating deployment processes and minimizing manual errors. The project integrates GitLab CI/CD pipelines to facilitate continuous testing, building, and deployment of infrastructure code changes, ensuring a reliable and up-to-date GCP environment. Specifically, the project demonstrates deploying a website to GCP using Terraform, showcasing the automation of resource provisioning, such as Compute Engine instances, Storage Buckets, and Cloud SQL databases. By utilizing Terraform's configuration files (.tf) and GitLab CI/CD pipelines, the project achieves a streamlined and efficient GCP infrastructure management process, highlighting the benefits of IaC and CI/CD methodologies in cloud resource management.
